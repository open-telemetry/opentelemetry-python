# Meter is responsible for creating and recording metrics

# exporter to export metrics to the console

# controller collects metrics created from meter and exports it via the

    "requests", "number of requests", 1, int, Counter, ("environment",)

# Labelsets are used to identify key-values that are associated with a specific
# metric that you want to record. These are useful for pre-aggregation and can
# be used to store custom dimensions pertaining to a metric

# The meter takes a dictionary of key value pairs
label_set = meter.get_label_set({"environment": "staging"})

# Handle usage
# You can record metrics with metric handles. Handles are created by passing in
# a labelset. A handle is essentially metric data that corresponds to a specific
# set of labels. Therefore, getting a handle using the same set of labels will
# yield the same metric handle.
counter_handle = counter.get_handle(label_set)
counter_handle.add(100)

# Direct metric usage
# You can record metrics directly using the metric instrument. You pass in a
# labelset that you would like to record for.
counter.add(25, label_set)

# Record batch usage
# You can record metrics in a batch by passing in a labelset and a sequence of
# (metric, value) pairs. The value would be recorded for each metric using the
# specified labelset for each.
meter.record_batch(label_set, [(counter, 50), (counter2, 70)])
