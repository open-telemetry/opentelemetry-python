# Overview

This example shows how to use the [`opentelemetry-ext-opentracing-shim`
package](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python/tree/master/ext/opentelemetry-ext-opentracing-shim)
to interact with libraries instrumented with
[`opentracing-python`](https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-python).

The included `rediscache` library creates spans via the OpenTracing Redis
integration,
[`redis_opentracing`](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/python-redis).
Spans are exported via the Jaeger exporter, which is attached to the
OpenTelemetry tracer.

## Installation

### Jaeger

Install and run
[Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/getting-started/#all-in-one).
See the [basic tracer
example](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python/tree/master/examples/basic-tracer)
for more detail.

### Redis

Install Redis following the [instructions](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart).

Make sure that the Redis server is running by executing this:

```sh
$ redis-server
```

### Python Dependencies

Install the Python dependencies in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt):

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can install the Python dependencies separately:

```sh
$ pip install \
  opentelemetry-api \
  opentelemetry-sdk \
  opentelemetry-ext-jaeger \
  opentelemetry-opentracing-shim \
  redis \
  redis_opentracing
```

## Run the Application

The example script calculates a few Fibonacci numbers and stores the results in
Redis. The script, the `rediscache` library, and the OpenTracing Redis
integration all contribute spans to the trace.

To run the script:

```sh
$ python main.py
```

After running, you can view the generated trace in the Jaeger UI.

#### Jaeger UI

Open the Jaeger UI in your browser at
<http://localhost:16686> and view traces for the
"OpenTracing Shim Example" service.

Each `main.py` run should generate a trace, and each trace should include
multiple spans that represent calls to Redis.

Note that tags and logs (OpenTracing) and attributes and events (OpenTelemetry)
from both tracing systems appear in the exported trace.
