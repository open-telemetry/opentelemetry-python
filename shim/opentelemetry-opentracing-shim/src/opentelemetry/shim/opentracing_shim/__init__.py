"""
The OpenTelemetry OpenTracing shim is a library which allows an easy migration
from OpenTracing to OpenTelemetry.

The shim consists of a set of classes which implement the OpenTracing Python
API while using OpenTelemetry constructs behind the scenes. Its purpose is to
allow applications which are already instrumented using OpenTracing to start
using OpenTelemetry with a minimal effort, without having to rewrite large
portions of the codebase.

To use the shim, a :class:`TracerShim` instance is created and then used as if
it were an "ordinary" OpenTracing :class:`opentracing.Tracer`, as in the
following example::

    import time

    from opentelemetry import trace
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
    from opentelemetry.shim.opentracing_shim import create_tracer

    # Define which OpenTelemetry Tracer provider implementation to use.
    trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())

    # Create an OpenTelemetry Tracer.
    otel_tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

    # Create an OpenTracing shim.
    shim = create_tracer(otel_tracer)

    with shim.start_active_span("ProcessHTTPRequest"):
        print("Processing HTTP request")
        # Sleeping to mock real work.
        time.sleep(0.1)
        with shim.start_active_span("GetDataFromDB"):
            print("Getting data from DB")
            # Sleeping to mock real work.
            time.sleep(0.2)

Note:
    While the OpenTracing Python API represents time values as the number of
    **seconds** since the epoch expressed as :obj:`float` values, the
    OpenTelemetry Python API represents time values as the number of
    **nanoseconds** since the epoch expressed as :obj:`int` values. This fact
    requires the OpenTracing shim to convert time values back and forth between
    the two representations, which involves floating point arithmetic.

    Due to the way computers represent floating point values in hardware,
    representation of decimal floating point values in binary-based hardware is
    imprecise by definition.

    The above results in **slight imprecisions** in time values passed to the
    shim via the OpenTracing API when comparing the value passed to the shim
    and the value stored in the OpenTelemetry :class:`opentelemetry.trace.Span`
    object behind the scenes. **This is not a bug in this library or in
    Python**. Rather, this is a generic problem which stems from the fact that
    not every decimal floating point number can be correctly represented in
    binary, and therefore affects other libraries and programming languages as
    well. More information about this problem can be found in the
    `Floating Point Arithmetic\\: Issues and Limitations`_ section of the
    Python documentation.

    While testing this library, the aforementioned imprecisions were observed
    to be of *less than a microsecond*.

    Unlike other classes in this package, the `ScopeShim` class doesn't wrap an
    OpenTelemetry class because OpenTelemetry doesn't have the notion of
    "scope" (though it *does* have similar functionality).

    There are two ways to construct a `ScopeShim` object: using the default
    initializer and using the :meth:`from_context_manager()` class method.

    It is necessary to have both ways for constructing `ScopeShim` objects
    because in some cases we need to create the object from an OpenTelemetry
    `opentelemetry.trace.Span` context manager (as returned by
    :meth:`opentelemetry.trace.use_span`), in which case our only way of
    retrieving a `opentelemetry.trace.Span` object is by calling the
    ``__enter__()`` method on the context manager, which makes the span active
    in the OpenTelemetry tracer; whereas in other cases we need to accept a
    `SpanShim` object and wrap it in a `ScopeShim`. The former is used mainly
    when the instrumentation code retrieves the currently-active span using
    `ScopeManagerShim.active`. The latter is mainly used when the
    instrumentation code activates a span using
    :meth:`ScopeManagerShim.activate`.

            `opentelemetry.trace.Span` from its ``__enter__()`` method. Used
