Take care not to use the "invoked ARN" directly but replace any
[alias suffix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-aliases.html) with the resolved function version, as the same runtime instance may be invokable with multiple

On some providers, it may not be possible to determine the full ID at startup,
which is why this field cannot be made required. For example, on AWS the account ID
