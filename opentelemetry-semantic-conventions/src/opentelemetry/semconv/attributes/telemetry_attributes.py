The name of the telemetry SDK as defined above.
Note: The OpenTelemetry SDK MUST set the `telemetry.sdk.name` attribute to `opentelemetry`.
    If another SDK, like a fork or a vendor-provided implementation, is used, this SDK MUST set the
    `telemetry.sdk.name` attribute to the fully-qualified class or module name of this SDK's main entry point
    or another suitable identifier depending on the language.
    The identifier `opentelemetry` is reserved and MUST NOT be used in this case.
    All custom identifiers SHOULD be stable across different versions of an implementation.
