PROCESS_ARGS_COUNT: Final = "process.args_count"
"""
Length of the process.command_args array.
Note: This field can be useful for querying or performing bucket analysis on how many arguments were provided to start a process. More arguments may be an indication of suspicious activity.
"""

PROCESS_COMMAND: Final = "process.command"
"""
The command used to launch the process (i.e. the command name). On Linux based systems, can be set to the zeroth string in `proc/[pid]/cmdline`. On Windows, can be set to the first parameter extracted from `GetCommandLineW`.
"""

PROCESS_COMMAND_ARGS: Final = "process.command_args"
"""
All the command arguments (including the command/executable itself) as received by the process. On Linux-based systems (and some other Unixoid systems supporting procfs), can be set according to the list of null-delimited strings extracted from `proc/[pid]/cmdline`. For libc-based executables, this would be the full argv vector passed to `main`.
"""

PROCESS_COMMAND_LINE: Final = "process.command_line"
"""
The full command used to launch the process as a single string representing the full command. On Windows, can be set to the result of `GetCommandLineW`. Do not set this if you have to assemble it just for monitoring; use `process.command_args` instead.

"""
Specifies whether the context switches for this data point were voluntary or involuntary.
"""

PROCESS_CPU_STATE: Final = "process.cpu.state"

"""
Deprecated: Replaced by `process.executable.build_id.htlhash`.
"""

PROCESS_EXECUTABLE_NAME: Final = "process.executable.name"
"""
The name of the process executable. On Linux based systems, can be set to the `Name` in `proc/[pid]/status`. On Windows, can be set to the base name of `GetProcessImageFileNameW`.
"""

PROCESS_EXECUTABLE_PATH: Final = "process.executable.path"
"""
The full path to the process executable. On Linux based systems, can be set to the target of `proc/[pid]/exe`. On Windows, can be set to the result of `GetProcessImageFileNameW`.

"""
The exit code of the process.

"""
The date and time the process exited, in ISO 8601 format.

"""
The PID of the process's group leader. This is also the process group ID (PGID) of the process.
"""

PROCESS_INTERACTIVE: Final = "process.interactive"
"""
Whether the process is connected to an interactive shell.
"""

PROCESS_LINUX_CGROUP: Final = "process.linux.cgroup"
"""
The control group associated with the process.
Note: Control groups (cgroups) are a kernel feature used to organize and manage process resources. This attribute provides the path(s) to the cgroup(s) associated with the process, which should match the contents of the [/proc/<PID>/cgroup](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html) file.
"""

PROCESS_OWNER: Final = "process.owner"
"""
The username of the user that owns the process.
"""

PROCESS_PAGING_FAULT_TYPE: Final = "process.paging.fault_type"
"""
The type of page fault for this data point. Type `major` is for major/hard page faults, and `minor` is for minor/soft page faults.
"""

PROCESS_PARENT_PID: Final = "process.parent_pid"
"""
Parent Process identifier (PPID).
"""

PROCESS_PID: Final = "process.pid"
"""
Process identifier (PID).

"""
The username of the saved user.
"""

PROCESS_SESSION_LEADER_PID: Final = "process.session_leader.pid"
"""
The PID of the process's session leader. This is also the session ID (SID) of the process.
"""

PROCESS_TITLE: Final = "process.title"
"""
Process title (proctitle).
Note: In many Unix-like systems, process title (proctitle), is the string that represents the name or command line of a running process, displayed by system monitoring tools like ps, top, and htop.
"""
