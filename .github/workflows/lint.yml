  # This is needed because we do not clone the core repo in contrib builds anymore.
  # When running contrib builds as part of core builds, we use actions/checkout@v4 which
  # does not set an environment variable (simply just runs tox), which is different when
  # contrib builds are run directly from contrib (since test.yml is executed, which sets CORE_REPO_SHA)
  # The solution is to include CORE_REPO_SHA as part of THIS environment so it can be accessed
  # from within the contrib build.
