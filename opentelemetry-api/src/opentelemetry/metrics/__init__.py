"""
The OpenTelemetry metrics API describes the classes used to report raw
measurements, as well as metrics with known aggregation and labels.

The `Meter` class is used to construct `Metric` s to record raw statistics
as well as metrics with predefined aggregation.

See the `metrics api`_ spec for terminology and context clarification.
