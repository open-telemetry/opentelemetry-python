The OpenTelemetry tracing API describes the classes used to generate
distributed traces.

The :class:`.Tracer` class controls access to the execution context, and
manages span creation. Each operation in a trace is represented by a
:class:`.Span`, which records the start, end time, and metadata associated with
the operation.

This module provides abstract (i.e. unimplemented) classes required for
tracing, and a concrete no-op ``BlankSpan`` that allows applications to use the
API package alone without a supporting implementation.

The tracer supports creating spans that are "attached" or "detached" from the
context. By default, new spans are "attached" to the context in that they are
created as children of the currently active span, and the newly-created span
becomes the new active span::

    # TODO (#15): which module holds the global tracer?
    from opentelemetry.api.trace import tracer

    # Create a new root span, set it as the current span in context
    with tracer.start_span("parent"):
        # Attach a new child and update the current span
        with tracer.start_span("child"):
            do_work():
        # Close child span, set parent as current
    # Close parent span, set default span as current

When creating a span that's "detached" from the context the active span doesn't
change, and the caller is responsible for managing the span's lifetime::

    from opentelemetry.api.trace import tracer

    # Explicit parent span assignment
    span = tracer.create_span("child", parent=parent) as child:

    # The caller is responsible for starting and ending the span
    span.start()
    try:
        do_work(span=child)
    finally:
        span.end()

Applications should generally use a single global tracer, and use either
implicit or explicit context propagation consistently throughout.

        Create a new span. Start the span and set it as the current span in
        this tracer's context.

        By default the current span will be used as parent, but an explicit
        parent can also be specified, either a ``Span`` or a ``SpanContext``.
        If the specified value is ``None``, the created span will be a root
        span.

        On exiting the context manager stop the span and set its parent as the
        current span.

        Example::

            with tracer.start_span("one") as parent:
