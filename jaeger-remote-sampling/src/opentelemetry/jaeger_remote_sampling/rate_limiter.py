class RateLimiter(object):
    """
    RateLimiter is based on leaky bucket algorithm, formulated in terms
    of a credits balance that is replenished every time check_credit()
    method is called (tick) by the amount proportional to the time
    elapsed since the last tick, up to the max_balance. A call
    to check_credit() takes a cost of an item we want to pay with the
    balance. If the balance exceeds the cost of the item, the item is
    "purchased" and the balance reduced, indicated by returned value of
    true. Otherwise the balance is unchanged and return false.

    This can be used to limit a rate of messages emitted by a service
    by instantiating the Rate Limiter with the max number of messages a
    service is allowed to emit per second, and calling check_credit(1.0)
    for each message to determine if the message is within the rate limit.

    It can also be used to limit the rate of traffic in bytes, by setting
    credits_per_second to desired throughput as bytes/second, and calling
    check_credit() with the actual message size.
