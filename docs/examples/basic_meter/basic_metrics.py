This module serves as an example for a simple application using metrics.

It shows:
- How to configure a meter passing a sateful or stateless.
- How to configure an exporter and how to create a controller.
- How to create some metrics intruments and how to capture data with them.
- How to use views to specify aggregation types for each metric instrument.
