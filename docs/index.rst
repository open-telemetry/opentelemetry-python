This documentation describes the :doc:`opentelemetry-api <api/api>`,
:doc:`opentelemetry-sdk <sdk/sdk>`, and several `integration packages <#integrations>`_.

**Please note** that this library is currently in alpha, and shouldn't be
used in production environments.

Installation
------------

The API and SDK packages are available on PyPI, and can installed via pip:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install opentelemetry-api
    pip install opentelemetry-sdk

In addition, there are several extension packages which can be installed separately as::

    pip install opentelemetry-ext-{integration}

The extension packages can be found in :scm_web:`ext/ directory of the repository <ext/>`.

In addition, third party exporters are available:

* `Azure Monitor <https://github.com/microsoft/opentelemetry-exporters-python/tree/master/azure_monitor>`_

Installing Cutting Edge Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the project is pre-1.0, there may be significant functionality that
has not yet been released to PyPI. In that situation, you may want to
install the packages directly from the repo. This can be done by cloning the
repositry and doing an `editable
install <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs>`_:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python.git
    cd opentelemetry-python
    pip install -e ./opentelemetry-api
    pip install -e ./opentelemetry-sdk
    pip install -e ./ext/opentelemetry-ext-{integration}


Quick Start
-----------

OpenTelemetry can be used to emit distributed traces and metrics from your application.
The following are two simple examples using the API and SDK, you can find more
elaborated examples in `Examples`_.
